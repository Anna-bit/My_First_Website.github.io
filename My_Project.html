<h2>Creating flexible structures crucial for lifestyle change.</h2>		
<p class="quote">
In an increasing effort to curb the spread of COVID-19, there have been continuous changes and establishment of decisions, systems, processes and procedures to mitigate the associated risks not just in Kenya but on a global level. The government’s approach to protecting the citizens including the lockdown, closure of schools, mandatory wearing of face-mask in public, fighting illegal cross-border transmissions are just some measures to fighting the virus. There has been a continuous shift in the way of doing things some impacting us negatively others positively. Have you thought about where we will be as a country 6 months or 1 year from now? The government and society have a major role to play in curbing the spread of the virus and ultimately our own future.
</p>
<p> The reduced working hours for the workers in the banking and telecommunications sectors among other essential services providers means more time to spend with family; for the employer leads to reduced profits and ultimately pressure on the economy. It is very highly likely that e-commerce will thrive more than it has ever been in the past. It is time to re-think how to run your business in the digital age and still remain competitive in the market. With these ongoing disruptions it is important to rethink of how to adapt to the situations which may not change soon enough. The strain is in all aspects of our lives be it in the socio-economic, cultural, financial, political, healthcare, technological or educational.</p>	
<p>Most of our habits have revolved in the recent past. Majority of us have been forced to study and work remotely from home and others in employment handling robust work. Others are still working but on a pay cut, some away on unpaid leave and others rendered jobless. Private schools have chosen to go online so students are now studying at the comfort of their homes. Is it just a response to the pandemic or might it be the case in the near future? These lifestyle changes have been the most unexpected this year and the most unfavorable that is why an early shift of habit and mindset or rather an adaption to these unprecedented changes might be a potential solution to dealing with unforeseen problems.</p>

<h2>IMPACT OF EDUCATION SYSTEM ON SOCIETY</h2>		
<p class="quote">
“Do not train children to learning by force and harshness, but direct them to it by what amuses their minds, so that you may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each.“ -Plato
</p>
<p> There is a lot of excitement when education results are out. Each parent looks out for the performance of their kids. Those that have performed greatly are deeply appreciated and celebrated. But what about those that have not done well? They are reprimanded and most feel like total failures. In fact some parents go to the extent of forcing their kids to repeat school a year back just to have them do better. But is it worth all the trouble? Maybe the child has talents and skills that are yet to be discovered. It is one thing to be dissatisfied with the outcome of results but it should not negatively affect the child. The child has enough pressure and a hanging cloud of fear of not scoring better and failing to impress just to mention a few. A word of encouragement goes a long way to help them to feel more purposeful and energized to bring their best foot forward. A small degree of pressure can enhance their performance but otherwise it can be lethargic.</p>	
<p>In the recent past in my country especially, some horrific incidences have occurred confirming the societal expectations of a great academic results slip. For instance, a young boy threatens to commit suicide for missing national exams and in a similar case out of pressure to repeat class eight. But what is the point of conforming to the education system if it drives us to do such evil? To the extent of committing suicide or even falling severely sick and then passing on. A great starting point for a great education system is to target real life application of knowledge in the real world as compared to performance on paper that is majorly subjective to one’s ability to memorize. Education should be used for empowerment and not for conformity to the societal expectations. People should not just cram and load information in their brains to achieve academic excellence but be in a position to apply it in real life situations.</p>
